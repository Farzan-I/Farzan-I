<p>👋 Hi, I’m Farzan.</p>

<p>🧠 I’m interested in football, gaming (board and video), nature, technology, food and music.</p>

<p>📚 I’m currently learning how to code with <a href="https://github.com/Farzan-I?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=ruby&sort=">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Farzan-I?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=javascript&sort=">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Farzan-I?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=html&sort=">HTML</a>through Makers Academy coding bootcamp (April '22 intake) but love learning new languages!</p>

<p>🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on new projects, apps and/or websites.</p>

<p>📫 Reach me through Github, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farzan-imanzadeh-079a95a3/) email and phone (all can be provided) - make a pull request on a repo to get in touch.</p>

<p>📝 I also have a <a href="https://medium.com/@farzanimanzadeh">blog</a> if you want to know more about my coding journey.
